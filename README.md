### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe the labs were very helpful for completing the assignment, especially lab 3 which taught us about how to use APIs with JavaScript. I believe one of the features most people, incluiding myself, weren't able to successfull solve straight ahead, was poster_image fetching. I knew I had to use the "path" of the image in order to load the poster images in the movie grid, but I did not know how to find the base url where the images were located. It wasn't properly explained in the lessons nor course instructions, how to find it.

Add your response here

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

if I had more time, I would make my layout more compact, add more advanced css elements to make it look more appealing, add an image substitute to those movies that didn't have poster images and add some fo the stretch features. Nonethelesss, I'm pretty satisfied with how my work turned out.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

On my project demo, I received positive feedback on how I explained my project with my thought of process. The website funcionality performed perfectly during the demo. I noticed that my peers added an image to those movies that didn't have a poster image path. I thought that was pretty convenient since having an empty slot is inconvenient.
